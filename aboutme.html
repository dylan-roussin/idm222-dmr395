        <p>Hi! I'm Dylan Roussin and I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Interactive Digital Media. 
        I have experience working as a graphic designer and am very interested in learning about user interface and user experience design. 
        I also love making things and am interested in learning about devlopment and programming.</p> 

        <p>As a graphic designer, I worked on a variety of projects from creating advertisments, motion graphics, and clothing designs. 
        Working on graphics in a real world setting gave me insight into the process of working in a team, and learning to make changes based on client input.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I like working on projects using Arduino, my digital art projects, websites, music, or any other creative project I find interesting. 
        I love the process of making things, and all the ways in which these different creative processes can be combined.</p> 

        <p>In the future, I'd like to focus more of my time working on development and programming. 
        I find that I really enjoy the small increments of progress that come from creating something new, 
        and using the possibilities that programming allows means that I can create things I am interested in and passionate.</p>
